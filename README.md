# 3 TAV - Company homepage

This is a static web export from our headless CMS [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/), using [Staatic plugin](https://staatic.com/) and deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Deployment

Wordpress is hosted on a private cloud with a `.local` domain. Homepage is exported as a `zip` file and uploaded to GitHub. Build and deploy is automated with Netlify.

### 1. Export Wordpress instalation to static files

- Login in [Wordpress admin > Staatic](http://sl_wordpress.dockerserver.3tav.local/wp-admin/admin.php?page=staatic-publications), select **Publish now**, and wait ...
- Download *Active Publication* export and `unzip` it to folder `deploy`
- Copy contents of the `deploy` folder to the `/publication` folder (overwrite existing) ðŸŽˆ

```sh
cd deploy
rsync -av --ignore-existing --exclude=".*" . ~/3tav.github.io/publication
```

ðŸŽˆ Default export of `Staatic` plugin is without media files (faster export - The option "Symlink/Copy Uploads" in [Staatic/Deployment](http://sl_wordpress.dockerserver.3tav.local/wp-admin/admin.php?page=staatic-settings&group=staatic-deployment) is selected).

-> Copy all new media files (`wp-content`) manually from the server to `publiaction/wp-content` folder. Use folder compare tool, `rsync` etc.

```sh
cd publication
rsync -av --ignore-existing --exclude=".*" tritav@dockerserver:/shared/docker/company_homepage/sl_wordpress/wp-content/ ./publication/.
```

### 2. Test and post-process exported files (optional)

Examine and fix all the mistakes made by the WordPress plugin.

ðŸ§¸ Try to automate the fix by writing a script for every plugin mistake and add it to the `package.json`.

> Note: check if a fix is already automated at Netlify [**Build settings**](https://app.netlify.com/sites/3tav-si/configuration/deploys).

#### Testing: run local static server

```sh
cd publication
python -m http.server --bind example.local 8000 # with python installed
npx http-server -p 8080 -o # with node installed
```

Open browser and test this *localhost* version of the homepage.

#### Fix #1: missed `.local` domain name replacement by the Staatic plugin

```sh
yarn # install post-process tools
yarn replace # run replace fix
```

### 3. Upload to GitHub

Commit and push. Netlify should pick up the changes and update static deployment.
